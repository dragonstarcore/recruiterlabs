                        Recruiter Labs Limited (England and Wales, (Registration Number 12519674)) (” We”) are committed to
protecting and respecting your privacy.<br><br>
This policy sets out the basis on which any personal data we collect from you, or that you provide to us, will be
processed by us.<br><br>
<b>IP addresses and cookies</b><br><br>
We collect information about your computer, including (where available) your IP address, operating system
and browser type, for system administration. This is statistical data about our users’ browsing actions and
patterns, and we will not use it in isolation to identify you or any individual. If you provide us with personal
data, such as your name, we will then match your IP address and browsing history (for example) with that
personal data.<br><br>
For the same reason, we may obtain information about your general internet usage by using a cookie file
which is stored on your device. Cookies help us to improve the Website and to deliver better and more
personalised content. For more information about our use of cookies on the Website, please refer to our
Cookie Policy.<br><br>
If your computer is shared with other people, we advise that you do not select the ‘remember my details’
option when that option is offered by the Website.<br><br>

<b>Where your personal information is stored and processed</b><br><br>
As explained in the “Sharing with third parties” paragraph on our GDPR page, we share your personal
information with the following:<br><br>
* Third party suppliers, contractors or agents: where we use a third-party supplier, contractor or agent,
your personal information remains under our control and we have controls in place to ensure your
personal information is adequately protected.<br>
* We endeavour to take all steps reasonably necessary to ensure that your personal information is
treated securely and in accordance with this Policy<br><br>

<b>Do we transfer your data outside the European Union?</b><br><br>

Your personal information can be transferred and processed in one or more other countries, in or outside the
European Union. We shall only transfer your data outside the EU to countries which the European Commission
believes offers an adequate level of protection to you, or where Recruiter Labs Limited has put in place
appropriate safeguards to seek to preserve the privacy of your information. Those countries include the US.<br><br>
<b>Data Security</b><br><br>
Although we will do our best to protect your personal information, you should be aware that the transmission
of information via the internet is not completely secure and we cannot guarantee the security of your personal
information transmitted to the Website or any third party; for this reason, any transmission is at your own risk.
We will use strict operational procedures and adequate, technical and organisational security measures to
prevent any unauthorised access, change, deletion or transmission of this personal information.<br><br>

confirmation whether we process any of your personal information. Where this is the case, you may
have access to your personal information and to certain information about how it is processed. In
some cases, you can ask us to provide you with an electronic copy of your information.<br>
* Right to correct your personal information: If you can demonstrate that personal information we hold
about you is not correct, you can ask that this information is updated or otherwise corrected.<br>
* Right to be forgotten/have data deleted: In certain circumstances, you have the right to have your
personal data deleted. You may make such a request at any time and Recruiter Labs Limited will
evaluate if your request should be granted, however this right is subject to any legal rights or

To the extent our processing of your personal information is based on your consent, you also have the right to
withdraw your consent at any time. Withdrawal of your consent will not affect the lawfulness of any
processing based on your consent before the receipt of such withdrawal.<br><br>
You can also lodge a complaint about our processing of your personal information with your local data
protection authority.<br><br>

<b>Marketing communications</b><br><br>
We will only send marketing communications to you via email or other communication means where you have
consented that we may do so.<br><br>
We will usually offer you a check box on the forms we use to collect your personal information where, if you
agree to receive marketing communications, you must click the box. Where we send marketing
communications to you via email, you may opt out of receiving any further marketing communications by
clicking the ‘unsubscribe’ or ‘opt-out’ function in the email. In addition, you can also exercise your opt-out
